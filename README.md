In-silico-Systems-Biology
=========================

The latex and R code used in book chapter in "In silico Systems Biology:  A systems-based approach to understanding biological processes" published by Humana Press. This book is part of the `Methods in Molecular Biology` series. The authors of this chapter are [Andrew Golightly](http://www.mas.ncl.ac.uk/~nag48/) and [Colin Gillespie](http://www.mas.ncl.ac.uk/~ncsg3/)

### Latex code

The latex code should compile using either *latex* or *pdflatex*. The figures are found in the graphics directory. The graphics directory contains both eps and pdf graphic files.

### R code

The R code used in this chapter is found in the R directory. The code is not meant for *industrial style* stochastic simulation. Rather, it is used to illustrate algorithms described in the chapter. The code has been placed into a simple R package. More details to follow.
