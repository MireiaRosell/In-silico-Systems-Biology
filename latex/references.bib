abstract = {Moment closure approximations are used to provide analytic approximations to non-linear stochastic population models. They often provide insights into model behaviour and help validate simulation results. However, existing closure schemes typically fail in situations where the population distribution is highly skewed or extinctions occur. In this study we address these problems by introducing novel second- and third-order moment closure approximations which we apply to the stochastic SI and SIS epidemic models. In the case of the SI model, which has a highly skewed distribution of infection, we develop a second-order approximation based on the beta-binomial distribution. In addition, a closure approximation based on mixture distribution is developed in order to capture the behaviour of the stochastic SIS model around the threshold between persistence and extinction. This mixture approximation comprises a probability distribution designed to capture the quasi-equilibrium probabilities of the system and a probability mass at 0 which represents the probability of extinction. Two third-order versions of this mixture approximation are considered in which the log-normal and the beta-binomial are used to model the quasi-equilibrium distribution. Comparison with simulation results shows: (1) the beta-binomial approximation is flexible in shape and matches the skewness predicted by simulation as shown by the stochastic SI model and (2) mixture approximations are able to predict transient and extinction behaviour as shown by the stochastic SIS model, in marked contrast with existing approaches. We also apply our mixture approximation to approximate a likelihood function and carry out point and interval parameter estimation.},

@article{Gomez-Uribe2007,
abstract = {The intrinsic stochastic effects in chemical reactions, and particularly in biochemical networks, may result in behaviors significantly different from those predicted by deterministic mass action kinetics (MAK). Analyzing stochastic effects, however, is often computationally taxing and complex. The authors describe here the derivation and application of what they term the mass fluctuation kinetics (MFK), a set of deterministic equations to track the means, variances, and covariances of the concentrations of the chemical species in the system. These equations are obtained by approximating the dynamics of the first and second moments of the chemical master equation. Apart from needing knowledge of the system volume, the MFK description requires only the same information used to specify the MAK model, and is not significantly harder to write down or apply. When the effects of fluctuations are negligible, the MFK description typically reduces to MAK. The MFK equations are capable of describing the average behavior of the network substantially better than MAK, because they incorporate the effects of fluctuations on the evolution of the means. They also account for the effects of the means on the evolution of the variances and covariances, to produce quite accurate uncertainty bands around the average behavior. The MFK computations, although approximate, are significantly faster than Monte Carlo methods for computing first and second moments in systems of chemical reactions. They may therefore be used, perhaps along with a few Monte Carlo simulations of sample state trajectories, to efficiently provide a detailed picture of the behavior of a chemical system.},

abstract = {Although stochastic population models have proved to be a powerful tool in the study of process generating mechanisms across a wide range of disciplines, all too often the associated mathematical development involves nonlinear mathematics, which immediately raises difficult and challenging analytic problems that need to be solved if useful progress is to be made. One approximation that is often employed to estimate the moments of a stochastic process is moment closure. This approximation essentially truncates the moment equations of the stochastic process. A general expression for the marginal- and joint-moment equations for a large class of stochastic population models is presented. The generalisation of the moment equations allows this approximation to be applied easily to a wide range of models. Software is available from http://pysbml.googlecode.com/ to implement the techniques presented here.},
